1. What is in this repository

This ia a repository of the Android apps that are developed for the Messer Group. They can be downloaded and installed as is on an android device and should run. The code is however not optimzed as it was generated by a framework and packaged for android without specialized build. The advantage of this approach is that the code remains readable and can be adapted for other applications.

2. How to optimze the build

Following things should be done to optimze the android app:

- the dojo toolkit  package should be replaced by an optimized build 
- the js files should be mimified by closure  or similar
- the app is written with a version of phonegap 3.0
- the language versions where generated by the framework and thus every language generates a index.html file instead of a i18n file. This could be rewritten

p.s. The source code was originally written for dojo 1.6 and although partially reworked the source code contains still certain formatting for dojo 1.6.
