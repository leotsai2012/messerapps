1. Description

Industrial gas valves are gas- and country specific: find out which valve is utilised in which country for which gas. It will help you to avoid a situation where you have to find out that the pressure regulator is not adapted to the industrial gas cylinders that are provided in the project country.

The valve types are stored in an on-line database and we invite everybody to complement this database with country-specific information of countries where the Messer Group is not present.
